        <h2 class="heading-highlight">For Students</h2>
        <p>
            Students can explore a list of available courses with active staff availability. With built-in filtering options, students can quickly locate the course and staff they need. Once they choose a course, they can view a list of staff members for that course and book appointments based on the staff's available time slots. If no available slots match their needs, students can send a custom request to the staff, which will appear in the staff's Pending Requests section.  
            <li>Browse Available Courses – Use the filters to search for specific courses by Course Tag and Course ID.</li>
            <li>Select a Course and Staff – View the list of staff associated with the course and select a staff member.</li>
            <li>View Staff Availability – View the availability calendar and book an appointment in an open slot. If an appointment outside of the staff's availability, it will send a request to the staff.</li>

            <li>View Your Weekly Calendar – View upcoming appointments and availability.</li>
            <li>Create Availability – Add open time slots where students can book appointments.</li>
