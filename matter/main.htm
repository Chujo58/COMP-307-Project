        <h3>📚 For Students</h3>
        <p>
            Students can explore a list of available courses with active staff availability. With built-in filtering options, students can quickly locate the course and staff they need. Once they choose a course, they can view a list of staff members for that course and book appointments based on the staff's available time slots. If no available slots match their needs, students can send a custom request to the staff, which will appear in the staff's **Pending Requests** section.
